**XV6-Copy-on-Write**

In the XV6 operating system, the implementation of Copy-On-Write (COW) on fork enhances memory management efficiency by deferring memory copying until necessary. When a fork system call is invoked in XV6, a new child process is created, which initially shares the same memory image as the parent process. However, rather than duplicating the entire memory space immediately, XV6 utilizes COW to optimize memory usage.

With COW, the parent and child processes initially share the same memory pages. However, when either process attempts to modify a shared memory page, a copy of the page is created for that process, ensuring that modifications do not affect the other process sharing the original page. This copy-on-write strategy minimizes unnecessary memory copying and conserves system resources, particularly beneficial when dealing with large memory allocations.
